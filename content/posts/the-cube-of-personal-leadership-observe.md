Feedback can be based on interpretations or observations.

Feedback based on interpretations means that the person who gives the feedback makes assumptions about what he or she sees. And we know: an assumption is the mother of all fuck-ups.

Feedback based on observations can never be false. An observation contains no opinion, no assumption. It contains the truth and nothing more. And it's a lot easier to continue a conversation based on a truth that both parties can agree on.

Give feedback based on observations instead of interpretations.
